//Problem Statement:
//It's dinner time in Castle Camelot, and the fearsome Knights of the Round Table are clamouring for dessert.
//You, the chef, are in a soup. There are N knights, including King Arthur, each with a different preference for dessert, but you cannot afford to make desserts for all of them.
//You are given the cost of manufacturing each Knight's preferred dessertâ€“since it is a round table, the list starts with the cost of King Arthur's dessert, and goes counter-clockwise.
//You decide to pick the cheapest desserts to make, such that for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert.
//This will ensure that the Knights do not protest.
//What is the minimum cost of tonight's dinner, given this condition?
//For instance, suppose there are 5 Knights and their desserts cost 1, 2, 1, 2 and 2.
//In this case, the minimum cost is 4, which you can achieve by feeding the first, third and fourth (or fifth) Knights.
//
//Input format
//There are 2 lines of input.
//The first line contains a single integer N, the number of seats at the table.
//The next line contains N space separated integers, each being the cost of the dessert of a Knight, listed in counterclockwise order around the table, starting with King Arthur.
//
//Output format
//The output should be a single line containing a single integer, the minimum possible cost for you, the chef.
//
//
//Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
